The wall can move very slowly: 5 feet as a full round action; but must maintain its original shape and size. You direct the wall's movement as a free action on your turn. Walls must remain in contact with the ground if normally required to do so. This feat can only affect straight, vertical walls. If moving in a certain direction would force the wall to bend, break, or otherwise change its shape; it cannot move in that direction and you will know this. You can continue to direct the wall's movement for either the spell's normal duration or 1 minute/level (if the wall's duration is instantaneous or permanent). If the wall's normal duration is instantaneous, while under the effects of this feat it can be dispelled as if it had a duration other than instantaneous. Instantaneous Conjuration (Creation) school walls that are dispelled end the wall's ability to move but do not affect the wall otherwise. Solid walls (such as wall of stone, wall of iron, or wall of force) can automatically push Medium or smaller creatures out of their space. Such creatures caught between them and another solid structure, take damage equal to your caster level per round when the creature's actual space is squeezed against something solid. A successful Reflex save versus the wall's normal spell DC negates the damage for that round and allows the creature to move at half speed along the wall. Climbing over such a wall is a valid method of escape as is cutting through the wall with weapons (especially adamantine weapons). Animated Walls cannot push or crush creatures of larger than Medium size. Damaging walls (such as wall of thorns, blade barrier, or wall of fire) deal their normal damage per round when they push against a creature's square. Again, a Reflex save versus the wall's normal spell DC negates the damage for that round. These types of walls cannot push or crush creatures. Wall of ice deals the damage listed for solid walls unless the creature breaks through (Strength check DC 15 + wall's spell level); then it does the damage listed for the wall of ice spell. Wall of ice can push Medium or smaller creatures just as other solid walls can. Some walls can not deal damage in this way (such as wind wall and illusory wall) and either have their normal effects or are dissipated when pushed against the creature's square. An Animate Wall spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level.","Normal":"Your wall spells do not move.","Special":"","Link":"https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Animate_Wall_(3.5e_Feat)"},{"Name":"Another Slice of Shade [General]","Description":"You summon the night within to guide your blade.","Prerequisite":"Shadowblade 5th, ability to use darkness as a spell-like or supernatural ability","Benefit":"You may convert one of your daily uses of your darkness ability to use an additional unseen weapon power per round.

Adepts generally replace both Clerics and Wizards in cultures which lack these classes, and many of their spells resemble arcane spells, but they are nevertheless normally classed as divine spellcasters. This feat allows an Adept (or any class which offers Adept spellcasting progression, such as the Theology advanced study option of the Sage prestige class) to study this form of magic on an \"intellectual\" rather than a \"spiritual\" basis, transforming him/her into an arcane caster. The relevant casting attribute changes from Wisdom to Intelligence, and the Arcane Adept learns and prepares spells like a Wizard does, maintaining a spellbook.\nThe Arcane Adept becomes eligible to take feats and prestige classes normally reserved for arcane casters only. A Master Arcanist can gain access to the Adept spell list by taking one level of Arcane Adept. The feat can also be of benefit to characters who never take a level of Adept: the character's ability to treat Adept spells as arcane has implications for spells such as limited wish, and for any arcane prestige class abilities that give access to spells from other arcane classes. The Arcane Adept loses the ability to qualify for divine-only feats and prestige classes (though he/she retains the ability to cast Adept spells from divine scrolls, and can copy them into his/her arcane spellbook). Other special abilities based on the specific nature and origin of a divine Adept's magic are lost too, such as the Skraal \"place-magic\" ability.","Normal":"","Special":"This feat is normally taken on or before the character's first level of Adept spellcasting ability.

When used against a target that is vulnerable to electricity, soaking wet, standing or swimming in water, wearing metal armor or using a metal shield or is otherwise holding or carrying a large quantity of conductive metal, the spell is more effective. Affected targets must roll their Reflex save against the spell twice and take the worst result.

In addition, if the spell is a melee touch spell it can be used as a ranged touch spell with a range of 25ft. +5ft. per 2 caster levels. However, if the spell is used as a ranged touch spell, the caster is forced to target the nearest applicable target and cannot target anything further away than the nearest applicable targets. For these purposes, the largest body of conductive metal (or the creature carrying it) is always the nearest applicable target. If the caster is the nearest applicable target, then they are in fact targeted by their own spell. This \"retargeting\" occurs even if the caster is unaware of it (using their normal attack but changing the target based on conductivity). If a creature or object affected by a conductive spell are not applicable targets (not wet, not carrying metal, not vulnerable to electricity and so forth) then the spell affects them normally with no additional effect.

This is a magical concoction of herbs and minerals that replicates the effect of one of the spells listed below. Much like a potion, anyone who possess the dust can use it as a standard action. Using the dust on another creature generally requires that the dust be sprinkled on the target and can only be used on adjacent creatures. This is performed as a touch attack that provokes an attack of opportunity. Each use of the feat produces enough dust for one use. Unlike with a potion, you do not need to know or be capable of casting the spell to create the dust. The secrets are contained in the individual recipes.\nCreating the dust takes one day. When you create the dust, you set the caster level, which must be sufficient to cast the spell in question and no higher than your own level. The base price of the dust is its spell level × its caster level × 25 gp. To create the dust, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one half this base price.\nThe faerie, at his or her discretion, may add an action to be performed in order for the dust to take effect. This action must be specified during creation to the dust during creation in order to work. The classic example is flying dust that only works when the user thinks happy thoughts. Other ideas include the user must dance a jig as the dust is applied, or the user must be wearing a pink kerchief. If the requirement calls for continuous action, the user may make a concentration check as a free action each round to continue to think happy thoughts (or whatever).

However, one of them must target one or more creatures and have a casting time of no more than 1 round. The other one must be a sphere-shaped emanation that has a timed duration (not concentration, instantaneous, or permanent). Crafting a flare takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. The base price of a flare is the sum of the two spells' levels × its caster level × 75 gp. To create a flare, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half of this base price.\nAny flare that stores a spell with a costly material component or an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost.

These flasks are called grenades. Crafting grenades take the same time and cost of crafting a potion. Using a grenade requires a ranged touch attack while wielding the flask. If the grenade contains a ranged touch effect, you must hit the target with it as a normal throwing weapon. A miss causes the spell effect to target the ground which it lands on (which may or may not have any effect). If the grenade contains an area effect spell, you need only make a ranged touch attack against AC3 (the ground's AC), though your range is limited by your throwing weapon distance rather than the spell's range. If you miss, the spell still goes off but may miss the targeted area (landing in the wrong spot as throwing weapons normally do). If you do miss, targets of the effect gain a +4 circumstance bonus to their saving throws against it. If you hit a targeted creature or object directly with a ranged touch attack, then they lose the benefits of Evasion and Improved Evasion (if they have it) against the grenade's effect but otherwise roll their saving throw normally (though this comes with a -4 penalty to the attack roll when using an area effect spell). A grenade flask has a hardness and number of hit points equal to the spell level +1. If a grenade flask shatters without being used as a thrown weapon, it has a 50% chance of setting off its spell (if an area effect) but otherwise merely destroys the item.","Normal":"","Special":"","Link":"https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Craft_Grenades_(3.5e_Feat)"},{"Name":"Craft Magic Food [Item Creation Feat]","Description":"You are able to imbue the foods you make with magic.","Prerequisite":"Ability to cast spells, Craft (Cuisine) rank 1","Benefit":"While preparing food, you are able to cast a spell on it.

A magic tattoo can be removed using a remove curse cast at one level higher than the spell level of the spell effect granted by the tattoo (using heighten spell or a similar method). The act of casting remove curse only takes away the magic. The tattoo itself remains until removed through mundane methods.

If your mount already has a fly speed, you may choose to retain the existing fly speed and maneuverability or replace them with the fly speed and maneuverability you are eligible for as a result of this feat. You must choose one option or the other, you cannot combine them. For example, if your mount has a fly speed of 40ft. with good maneuverability and this feat would entitle your mount to a fly speed of 60ft. with average maneuverability, you cannot gain a fly speed of 60ft. with good maneuverability. If your effective class or character level is high enough to grant a bonus to movement speed, such as a Paladin of 8th level or higher, that bonus is applied after determining the mount's base fly speed. In addition, the mount's fly speed does not increase as a result of such a feature. If the mount cannot breath air, and gains a fly speed as a result of this feat, it gains the ability to hold its breath when out of water for a number of rounds equal to half the mount's constitution modifier, rounded down. If this result is 0 or less, it does not gain the ability to hold its breath.\n\nIf the mount does not have limbs appropriate for making claw attacks, the mount does not gain claw attacks. If the mount has suitable limbs but already has a natural attack which corresponds with those limbs, you may choose to replace the existing natural attack with the pair of claw attacks to which the mount is entitled.\nFor example:\nA heavy warhorse has suitable limbs with a pair of hoof attacks. You may choose to replace this with a pair of claw attacks instead.\nA dire wolf has suitable limbs without a natural attack. The mount gains a pair of claw attacks.\nA dire bat does not have suitable limbs. It does not gain claw attacks.\n\nIf the creature does not gain claw attacks and does not already have a primary natural weapon, it gains a bite attack as a primary natural weapon. Otherwise, it gains a bite attack as a secondary natural weapon.\n\n\nYour effective class or character level for the purpose of determining your mount's abilities is reduced by 3, in addition to any penalties for non-standard mounts.

With this feat, a spell of one of the two types you selected can have its type changed from one to the other. Any damage the spell causes of its usual energy type is now changed into the new element type. Effects other than elemental damage will not change. A Dual Element Spell uses up a spell slot of its normal level.\nExample:\nDavoud is a wizard who learns this feat for fire and acid. He can opt to prepare his acid arrow spell normally, or he can apply this feat to it, and change the designator from Acid to Fire. The spell damage will now ignore acid resistance and be subject to fire resistance. It will still cause (fire) damage over three rounds. Likewise, he can prepare a fireball as either a fire or an acid spell.\nNotes:\nThis feat includes the benefit of the Fire to Ice feat from previous editions of the Netbook of Feats. Although in the SRD the Energy Substitution feat can be used with spells to cause Sonic damage, newer publications have updated this feat to no longer allow this, presumably as very few creatures have resistance to Sonic damage compared to the other energy types. As such the DM may similarly restrict this feat, or alternatively may allow spells to produce sonic damage but with the damage reduced by one die-size. For example, using this feat on Fireball would allow you to do 1d4 Sonic damage per level (maximum 10d4) rather than 1d6 Fire damage per level (maximum 10d6).\n\nRevised by the Netbook of Feats Review Board\n--\nAuthor: Carl Cramér  © Carl Cramér 2002    This feat is from the NBoF, please see NBoF Credits.\n\nNBoF Balance Rating (0 to 5 Scale)\n\n\nOverall\nPurp\nPow\nPort\nComp\nRule\n\n\n4.34\n4.30\n4.60\n4.60\n3.60\n4.60\n\n\n\n\nBack to Main Page → 3.5e Homebrew → Character Options → Feats → Metamagic Feats\n This page is protected from editing because it is distributed under the OGL.

The yelling is essential and you cannot perform a Falcon Punch if you are voiceless (for instance, under the influence of a Silence spell).

Any victim of this effect must also make a DC 15 Reflex save or be rendered prone. If the victim's backward movement is stopped by something, such as a wall, he or she takes an additional 3d6 damage that is treated as falling damage. Make a str. check (Max throwing distance + Str. mod) to see if you send the target threw the wall. If so, divide the distance that the target would go normally (Max throwing divided by 2 divided by HP of the wall).\nIf your target is pregnant and you succeeded on the attack roll, any embryos/fetuses/eggs must succeed on a DC 20 Fortitude save or be irrevocably destroyed.\nIf you succeded in your attack roll, any creature within 30ft of you must make a DC 20 Will save or be stunned by your awesomeness by one round.\nAfter you perform your Falcon Punch, and only if you succeeded on the attack roll, your character must pose and say \"Show ya moves!\" If any nearby enemies have Combat Reflexes or a similar effect, they get a second attack of opportunity against you. Taking that attack of opportunity is considered dishonorable by all but the most despicable villains, though.\nFalcon Punch has a cooldown time of 1d4 rounds, you must wait that long after a Falcon Punch before you can perform another.

For your entire life, you have been supernaturally prone to prophetic visions and delphic trances. The practical implementation of this power in a game setting can vary significantly. Visions can can be clear or obscure; they can be far-reaching predictions of future events, supernatural glimpses of past events, or merely vague and incomprehensible hallucinations. They can potentially consist of glowing images (visible only to you), spoken phrases, or apparently natural events which serve as omens to those with the skill and understanding to interpret them. The power's exact parameters are highly variable, and it is up to the referee (DM) to interpret this power as he or she sees fit. A peculiarity of this power is that it is only triggered spontaneously (at the DM's discretion), without the character's bidding. Examples for potential situations when the DM can choose for this power to trigger are:\nWhen the seer touches a featured object.\nWhen the seer touches another character or creature.\nWhen the seer is near death, goes unconscious, falls asleep, or wakes up.\nWhen the seer hears a meaningful word or the name of a meaningful creature.\nWhen the seer enters a key area or location.\nWhen the seer sees a key item or creature.\nCompletely spontaneously; seemingly without any particular stimulus.\nSpecial: Harboring the Gift of the Seer makes you a prime target for dark entities, enterprising kingdoms, and other individuals who would seek to capture you and exploit your power for their own benefit. For this reason, known bearers of the Gift are extraordinarily rare, even among the already minuscule percent of the global population that is psionically empowered.

Full-round -\u003e Standard -\u003e Move -\u003e Swift -\u003e Immediate. When you do this, your effective caster level with this spell is cut in half. The caster level cap of the spell is also dropped to half. These figures are rounded up. If the spell normally doesn't have a caster level cap, it instead gains one equal to (2 x its spell level). You cannot apply this feat to a spell if it would reduce your effective caster level below the minimum needed to learn the spell. You cannot apply this feat to a spell that creates a creature or object, a spell with an area of effect, or a spell that targets multiple creatures or objects. A hasty spell does not use up any spell slots higher, but sacrifices its own effectiveness in order to create a hasty casting. Casting a hasty spell still provokes attacks of opportunity as a normal spellcasting. This metamagic feat cannot be used in conjunction with any other metamagic effect on the same spell.\nHere are some examples:\nA 6th level cleric cast a hasty cure light wounds as a move action, they would only gain 1d8+2 hit points and a 10th level cleric would also only gain this reduced amount due to the normal caster level cap on cure light wounds (+5) being reduced by half (to +3).\nA 12th level wizard can cast a hasty magic missile as a move action, but they would only produce 3 magic missiles. Even though their effective caster level would be 6th, the cap on the spell also drops by half down to 5th instead of 9th (which is the normal caster level cap). Even then, the caster must focus all their missiles on one target since a hasty spell cannot target more than one creature or object per casting.\n\nAn 18th level wizard cannot cast a hasty limited wish spell. Their caster level would be reduced to 9th and since a wizard must be at least 13th level to learn 7th level spells like limited wish, he'd be unable to do so.","Normal":"","Special":"","Link":"https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Hasty_Spell_(3.5e_Feat)"},{"Name":"Hate [General]","Description":"Your hate for a specific creature allows you to be more proficient at killing them.","Prerequisite":"Int 13","Benefit":"The feat grants you the Favoured Enemy ability as if you were a 1st level Ranger.","Normal":"You must take a level of Ranger to gain the Favoured Enemy ability.","Special":"This feat may be selected multiple times.

If you need to prepare spells in advance, you must also be carrying the unmodified spell. Success is determined by a Spellcraft check with a DC of 10 plus twice the spell's modified level: if successful, you must sacrifice a spell of the modified level to power it. If the check fails, you can cast the unmodified spell if circumstances allow: alternatively, if you normally cast spells without preparation (and therefore already have the ability to apply metamagic Feats \"on the fly\" but with an increased casting time) you can still do this if circumstances allow.

Use of this power with multiple metamagic Feats is permitted, but all the metamagic enhancements will fail together if the single check fails. For instance, an attempt to cast a quickened magic missile without preparation requires knowledge of the spell and the Quicken Spell feat, a prepared magic missile (if you need to prepare spells), a 5th level spell slot (possibly occupied by another prepared spell), and a Spellcraft check with a DC of 20. Success indicates that the quickened spell can be cast, using the 5th level spell slot. Failure indicates that the caster must immediately cast the spell normally, requiring a standard action and using the 1st level spell slot, or abandon the spell (wasting the 1st level slot).

The Dancer must have at least one unused 2nd level spell slot to perform these Dances. She may only use these Mystical Dances a number of times per day equal to her Charisma modifier (entering Fire Lily Dance expends two uses). Once the Dancer has used half of her daily uses of Mystical Dances, one unused 2nd level spell slot becomes unusable for casting spells; however, that spell slot can still count as the slot that allows the Dancer to perform Mystical Dances.\nThese are the Mystical Dances:\nLavender Dance (Ex): The Lavender Dance is characterized by a visible blurring of the Dancers movements. The Dancer makes somewhat fast, circular motions, continuing every motion out into a fluid recovery. An overly exaggerated amount of motion blurring occurs, making it difficult to discern the Dancers actual position. Anyone who attacks a Dancer performing the Lavender Dance has a 20% chance to miss completely. True seeing negates the miss chance. To maintain the dance, she must either move more than 10ft, make a full attack, or take a move action to do nothing (except for continuing to dance). The DC for the Lavender Dance is 24. To learn the Lavender Dance, the Dancer must be at least class level 4.\nEglantine Dance (Ex): The Eglantine Dance is characterized by the slow, fluid movements, with hands close to the body. The motions associated are not for offense; they simply augment the use of magic to aid in healing. A Dancer performing the Eglantine Dance gains Fast Healing 3. To maintain the dance, she must either move more than 10ft or take a move action to do nothing (except for continuing to dance). The DC for the Eglantine Dance is 27. To learn the Eglantine Dance, the Dancer must be at least class level 7.\n\n\nThis is the Elite Mystical Dance:\n\nFire Lily Dance (Ex): The Fire Lily Dance is similar in technique to the Black Lily Dance, except that the Fire Lily Dance is much less furious; in fact, a careful observer will note that most motions are simply flourishes, not actual attacks. Upon actually making an attack, her weapon is suddenly sheathed in fire. When she hits her foe, the fire explodes out, burning everyone around him. Whenever a Dancer performing the Fire Lily Dance makes an attack and hits, she creates a small fireball, dealing 6d6 fire damage to everyone within 10ft, excluding the Dancer. A Reflex save, DC 14 + the Dancer's Charisma modifier, results in half damage. To maintain the dance, she must either move more than 10ft or take a move action to do nothing (except for continuing to dance).","Normal":"","Special":"","Link":"https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Mystical_Dances_(3.5e_Feat)"},{"Name":"Naginatajutsu [General]See Also","Description":"You are trained in the art of fighting with the naginata.

If you also have the Practiced Spellcaster feat, apply Practiced Spellcaster first, and reduce your remaining non-caster levels accordingly before applying Powercast: thus, the rogue/fighter in the previous example would count as having 3 non-caster levels rather than 7.","Normal":"","Special":"","Link":"https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Powercast_(3.5e_Feat)"},{"Name":"Powerful Build [General Fighter]","Description":"","Prerequisite":"Str 18 BaB +1","Benefit":"Your physical stature lets you function in many ways as if you were one size category larger.

You can use weapons designed for a creature one size larger without penalty. However, your space and reach remain those of a creature of your actual size. You may take this feat multiple times.

You must have a Con 14.","Benefit":"This is a scaling feat that improves with your HD. By adopting this feat you cannot take any feats later on in your progression.\nWhen activated this feat increases your visual capabilities further, growing in power as you grow more powerful. The Rinnegan may be activated as a free action for up to 2 minutes per HD per day; this duration need not be used all at once and may be broken up as you wish. The Rinnegan places a strain on your body's systems; exhausting the full maximum duration will cause you to suffer from blurred vision (-2 to attack rolls, spot and search checks) for one hour; you also become fatigued. When active, your eyes become pure purple with 6 black circles inlaid in a faded pale purple and glow very softly.\nAll the following abilities of the Rinnegan stack. All abilities marked as passive do not require your Rinnegan to be activated.\n\n1HD:Rinne Awakening - (Active) You have a +2 bonus to Spot and Search checks, as well as the unique power Black Receiver (Ex): By spending a minute you can create a 4'ft long black rod which while held can be used for telepathic communication for a maximum range of 100' feet. These rods will always remain active, and if the Rinnegan user can spend 5 minutes concentrating to contact a creautre in possesion of a rod that is more than 100' feet away. Passively, at all times you have a 1 in 3 chance (1-2 on d6) to notice non-magically hidden or concealed secret doors, sliding walls, etc. when passing within 5 feet of them. In the beginning, the Rinnegan have begun to develop their powers, you may easily manipulate the types of damage your energy based attacks inflict, changing their element to any of your choosing. You must declare this change before attacking.\n3HD:Six Paths Technique - (Active) You gain a +1 insight bonus to attack, and stun (1 round) your target on a confirmed melee critical hit; successful Fortification or immunity to critical strikes negate this stun. Passively, you gain low-light vision. Passively, the Six Paths Technique grants the user of the Rinnegan the ability to manipulate up to six bodies as though they are their own. The user embeds one or more black receivers (see Black Reciever (Ex)) into a body (preferably one that has passed away), allowing them to channel their soul-essence into it from great distances by performing a 24-hr ritual to imbue their soul-essence to make full use of the body. The user ideally transmits their soul-essence from the highest and closest point possible so that they can have the best possible range. Once their soul-essence enters the body, they are given complete control of it, allowing them to decide all of its actions, its use of spells if any, and even speak through it. When multiple bodies are controlled together the user is able to see through all of their eyes, thus registering six separate fields of vision at the same time. The creatures targeted by this ability must be humanoid, be sentient, and cannot exceed your HD. You gain all abilities of that possessed creature as well as the Path abilities given to that creature. There are a total of six paths, each path representing a different power specific to the path as described below. However, the Rinnegan user must maintain concentration on using this ability and thus cannot move, take any action, or cast any spell from their main body. However, the range the paths have for this ability initially is 60' ft, increasing to 120' ft at 7HD, 240' ft at 10HD, 500' ft at 15HD, and 1000' ft at 20HD. If any of the paths are moved or more outside this radius they lose their ability to function and become SRD:Paralyzed. Each path will level concurrently with the Rinnegan user having a specific role. They cannot gain any feats of their own and only gain bonuses from feats gained from the Rinnegan user. If a path is killed the Rinnegan user must take 12 hours to restore the body, however, if the body is destroyed they must seek out a new creature to fulfill the role. If the Rinnegan user is interrupted in its concentration, the paths stop moving and become extremely susceptible to attacks.\nDeva Path\nThe Deva path is considered the path of Bliss as well as the main body which the Rinnegan user will use besides their own body. The Deva path overwrites the class and abilities of the original user and grants them the class Gravitonic Master (3.5e Class). The Deva path does not have access to any racial special abilities that the Rinnegan user might have. The ability scores of the Deva path focus on strength and agility, as well as hardiness.\nAsura Path\nThe Asura path is considered the path of Reincarnation through the forgiveness of one's Demons. So it is often considered the Demon path. The Asura path overwrites the class and abilities of the original user and grants them the class Mechanist (3.5e Class). The Asura path does not have access to any racial abilities that the Rinnegan user might have. However, they would still retain any abilities gained from their previous class. The ability scores of the Asura path focus on purely offensive and defensive capabilities.\nHuman Path\nThe Human path is considered the path of Enlightenment through desire, and passion. The Human path overwrites the class and abilities of the original user and grants them the class Soul Reaver (3.5e Class). The Human path gains the additional ability to be able to return souls to the body if they have been taken as seen in the ability Soul Absorb (Su) by having the body make a Fortitude saving throw. In addition, by making a touch attack, the Human path may probe the mind of a creature. They make no saving throw if the touch attack succeeds. The Human path does not have access to any racial abilities that the Rinnegan user might have. However, they would still retain any abilities gained from their previous class. The ability scores of the Human path focus on purely Charisma and Wisdom to be in tune with the soul.\nAnimal Path\nThe Animal path is considered the path of Rebirth through the resolution of one's fears and instincts. The Animal path overwrites the class and abilities of the original user and grants them the class Summoner, Variant (3.5e Class). The Animal path also gains the unique ability known as Six Paths: Rinne Summoning (Su). This ability allows the Animal path to summon all other paths from any location to its current location, or transport to a pocket dimension while the Rinnegan user moves. The Rinnegan user can only use this ability 2/long rest. The Animal path may use this ability at will as a SRD: Swift Action. The Animal path does not have access to any racial abilities that the Rinnegan user might have. However, they would still retain any abilities gained from their previous class. The ability scores of the Animal path focus on purely Charisma and Wisdom to commune and command the animals summoned.\nPreta Path\nThe Preta Path is considered the path of Desire through a cultivation of experiences. The Preta path overwrites the class and abilities of the original user and grants them the class Barrier Mage (3.5e Class). The Preta Path grants all other paths a spell resistance equal to your Spellcraft skill level at 12th level. The Preta path does not have access to any racial abilities that the Rinnegan user might have nor any of the previous class abilities. In addition, the Preta path takes double damage when hit with a physical attack, and reduces magical damage by half. The ability scores of the Preta Path focus on Wisdom to concentrate on creating powerful barriers to protect both the other paths and other allies.\nNaraka Path\nThe Naraka Path is considered the path of Karmic rebirth. The Naraka path overwrites the class and abilities of the original user and grants them the class Healer (3.5e Class). The Naraka Path has the unique ability to cast healing spells and abilities at a distance from the unique ability known as Six Paths: Rinne Recovery (Su). The Naraka Path can use this 3/short rest. The Naraka Path does not have access to any racial abilities that the Rinnegan user might have nor do they retain any abilities gained from previous class(es). The ability scores of the Naraka Path focus Wisdom to make their healing spells stronger while being agile to be defensive.\n7HD: Path of Indra or Asura - At 7th level, the Rinnegan user must choose between the path of light, Asura, or the path of darkness, Indra. Depending on the path chosen, the Rinnegan user will gain unique abilities as described below.\nAsura\nPassively, any numerical die rolled, you roll an additional d6 of Light damage, d6 bonus to a skill, a d6 bonus to a saving throw. (Active) Whenever the Rinnegan user activates their Rinnegan changes color from a purple to a golden yellow color. In addition, 3/day you can cast the spell Teleport as a Standard Action.\nIndra\nPassively, whenever the Rinnegan user activates their Rinnegan changes color from a purple to a reddish color. Whenever you are forced to make a Will saving throw against a fear effect you gain an additional +5 bonus. (Active) While your Rinnegan is active when you would look at an opposing creature in their eyes, they must make a Will saving throw (DC:17) or be Frightened. The creature must continue to make Will saving throws until the creature succeeds.\n10HD: Sage of the Six Paths Technique - Passively, you gain the ability to see the invisible, you also gain a +2 bonus to Will saves to disbelieve illusions. (Active) The Rinnegan user, once per long rest can choose a single path to embody for the day. They gain all abilities and features of that path as well as their own class abilities. After using this ability the Rinnegan cannot cast spells, use abilities, or attack for minutes equal to their HD. Their movement is reduced to 15ft after using this ability. At 20th level, you may channel any number of paths at one time.\n15HD: Sage of the First Path Technique - Passively, you gain the ability to cast your sight ahead of you as Arcane Eye as well as your vision is now unhindered by smoke, fog, mist or dust to a range of 60 feet. (Active) Having the Rinnegan, you now have the ability to use the ability Limbo: Border Jail (Ex). To use this ability you must have the Rinnegan active. As a Standard Action, you create shadows that exist in the ethereal plane. These shadows which co-exist with the physical world are generally impossible to detect or visually perceive. The shadows can operate independently of the user, attacking and restraining target(s) or defending the original body from harm. They cannot cast spells and can only be damaged via magical weapons, or energy based spells. If you use this ability you cannot use the Six Paths Technique.\n20HD: Six Red Ying-Yang Formation - Passively, you gain a +2 to any skill of your choosing. (Active) As a Full Round Action, if you are using the Six Paths Technique, you can create the Six Red Ying-Yang Formation barrier. This barrier prevents any creature from entering or exiting. While in the 120' ft cube, all creatures cannot cast spells, and creatures cannot magically enter the area. The only way to enter or exit is to create small openings in the barrier to allow creatures in and out.","Normal":"","Special":"You cannot have this feat together with the Sharingan, Narugan, Byakugan, or Jiraigan feats.","Link":"https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Rinnegan_(3.5e_Feat)"},{"Name":"Riposte [General, Fighter]Notes","Description":"After deflecting your opponent's blow, you quickly attack while they are over extended.","Prerequisite":"Combat Expertise, Weapon Finesse, Base attack bonus +6","Benefit":"When unencumbered, in light armor or less, and using a weapon with Weapon Finesse, you may make an attack of opportunity against an opponent who tried to attack you in melee and missed.","Normal":"","Special":"This feat cannot be used if you are denied your Dexterity bonus to AC.

The benefit is that the spell takes up a spell slot one level lower than normal.\nSpecial: If you have an appropriate sacrifice, perform the ritual at the right time in the right place, or have an artifact or item of power or the ritual fits in the story, the DM may reduce the required spell slot even further. This feat is recommended for evil NPCs, whose terrible rituals the PCs must stop.\nNotes\nThis is particularly useful to divine spellcasters, who know high-level spells but normally just can't cast them. Many cleric spells do very well as rituals. Wizards can learn spells of a level they cannot normally cast, but must scribe it using the standard rules, not take it for free when they go up in level. Sorcerers and Bards can never learn spells that they cannot normally cast, and thus find this feat almost useless.\n\n--\nAuthor: Carl Cramér  © Carl Cramér 2001    This feat is from the NBoF, please see NBoF Credits.\nRevised by the Netbook of Feats Review Board\n\nNBoF Balance Rating (0 to 5 Scale)\n\n\nOverall\nPurp\nPow\nPort\nComp\nRule\n\n\n4.40\n4.75\n4.25\n4.00\n4.25\n4.75\n\n\nBack to Main Page → 3.5e Homebrew → Character Options → Feats → Metamagic Feats\n This page is protected from editing because it is distributed under the OGL.

Scrimshawing a bone takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. The base price of a bone is its spell level x its caster level x 25 gp. To scrimshaw a bone, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half of this base price. Any bone that stores a spell with a costly material component or an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. In addition to the costs derived from the base price, you must expend the material component or pay the XP when carving the bone.\nSpecial: When taking this feat, choose a school of magic (if you are a\nspecialist\nwizard, you must choose your\nspecialist\nschool).\nSpells you scrimshaw from this school are at +1 caster level (with no additional cost). Choose a second school of magic that you have access to. You may not scrimshaw spells of that school. If you are a\nspecialist wizard,\n\nyou may not choose one of your prohibited schools of magic.\nAbout Scrimshawed Bones\nA scrimshaw bone is a spell-completion item that does not provoke an\nattack of opportunity.\nScrimshawed bones must be at least one inch long for every level of spell contained upon them. Once a scrimshawed bone is discharged, the bone cracks, becoming powerless. Identifying a spell stored in a scrimshawed bone is automatic with Read Magic, or may be made after studying the bone for one minute and a successful Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). No scrimshawed bone may contain multiple spells.\n\nDesign\nThis feat is intended to replace Scribe Scroll, and should not be available to characters with access to Scribe Scroll or any feat intended to replace it. This feat is intended to improve game flavor (along with the other Alternate Item Feats), and in any particular campaign should have some requirement limiting the feat to a particular polity, organization, or race. It is slightly better than Scribe Scroll. This is deliberate, and meant to reward players for better integrating their characters with the world mileau. If this is not desired, then using a scrimshawed bone should draw an attack of opportunity, the feat possessor should not be barred from scrimshawing any spell she knows, and no school should have a caster level adjustment.\nThis Scribe Scroll replacement feat is intended for more primitive or otherwise unsophisticated casters. Evil humanoids, for example, might use this in place of Scribe Scroll. Another possibility would be to give scrimshaw bones an automatic Spell Focus effect for spells with the Evil descriptor instead of a caster level bonus and prohibited school.\nThe dungeon master should note that by default, using a scrimshawed bone does not draw an attack of opportunity. This is deliberate, to make a scrimshawed bone closer in function to a wand. When using alternate item creation feats, the world designer may wish to restrict anyone\nwith access to Scrimshaw Bone from gaining the Craft Wand or [[SRD:Craft Staff|Craft Staff] feat, in addition to other Scribe Scroll variants.\nAs an additional flavor variant and to emphasize political or racial discord, bones of humanoid type might be used by some other group to greater effect or with less effort. For example, the dungeonmaster might decide that orcs using hobgoblin bones scrimshaw spells at +1 caster level, or that goblins scrimshawing human bones get a 15% reduction in the base price for creation.\n\n\nBack to Main Page → 3.5e Homebrew → Character Options → Feats → Item Creation\n\n","Benefit":"You can scrimshaw a spell of any level that you know into a humanoid bone.

Serene Maneuver has no effect if you can't detect the target. Any Mind-Affecting ability that succeeds at harming you end the effects of Serene Maneuver. While Serene Maneuver is in effect you are unable to communicate by verbal or telepathic means. The AC gained from this ability is considered Dodge bonus and functions as long as Serene Maneuver is active and you are not immobilized.

The subschool of these spells changes from figment to shadow. An illusionist with this feat can use the altered spell to mimic any sorcerer or wizard conjuration (summoning), conjuration (creation), or evocation spell at least one level lower than the illusion spell. The altered spell functions identically to the shadow conjuration or shadow evocation spell (particularly in the sense that, if believed, it deals 100%, full effects on its targets), except that the spell’s strength equals 10% per level of the figment spell used (when disbelieved).\nIf the image made is simply a construct not intended for battle use, such as a magical stone elevator, it is stable and can hold up to 10 times your Caster-Level for every foot it has in depth while in contact with a stable structure, and the construct itself weighs 1/10th of a pound per cubic foot, but is unaffected by natural winds, quakes, or other natural disasters (magic-induced disasters will affect it normally. It is inflammable in reality, though it may appear to burn if the image is of something flammable. Unless through a spell that could normally lift its weight, a construct made using Shadow Illusion cannot fly through the image spell itself - though it can travel (at a rate of 20'/round) horizontally, diagonally, or vertically along a smooth surface as long as it remains in its area of effect. Due to its magical nature, Shadow Stuff is as tough as Adamantine, almost as light as air, but cannot leave the area of effect initially specified by the caster.\nIf the image made is food or water, it will sustain someone until they leave the area of effect, at which time their bodies behave as though they hadn't actually eaten anything.\nAn illusionist with this feat who uses silent image to create an acid splash effect would deal 10% of the normal damage to a creature that succeeds on its Will save to disbelieve the shadow, and would deal 100% damage to a creature that fails its will save. If she used programmed image to mimic summon monster V, the creature would have 60% of the hit points of a normal creature of its kind (regardless of belief), and its damage would be 60% normal against a creature that succeeds on its Will save to disbelieve or 100% against a crature that fails its will save. While calculating the damage, you would roll it normally and multiply it by the decimal version of the percent. In example, 60% of 100 is the same as .6 times 100, which is 60. As usual, you must round down. If you rolled 11 damage using a 9th level Silent Image spell (using Heighten Spell or some combination of other metamagic feats), you would multiply it by .9. You get 9.9 as a result, and you deal 9 damage.)\nAn illusionist whom applies this feat to Mirror Image or Greater Mirror Image casts the spell as a spell 2 levels higher than normal as though affected by a Metamagic Feat. Referring to the previous example of using a 9th level Silent Image to cast Acid Splash, if you had previously cast a Mirror Image Spell and created 4 Images, you would choose (before rolling) whether to multiply your rolled damage by 5 (# of Images + 1 (Yourself)), or to roll the equivalent dice separately. Choosing to multiply your rolled damage, you would multiply 11 x 5 = 55, and then take 90% of that, 55 * .9 = 49.5, round down, 49 Damage. In the case of Damage Reduction, the damage acts as though it came from one source due to the fact that the multiple projectiles have all stemmed from the casting of Mirror Image.\n\nGhost Sound can't be effectively used unless you use metamagic to raise it to a higher spell level because there is no spell level less than 0 in any official material.

If additional metamagic feats are applied to a specific recharge spell, the cooldown duration is doubled (maximum 24 hours) for each effective level increased beyond what Specific Recharge Spell alone requires. Once the cooldown period expires, the slot unlocks. You can then use the imprint at any time to prepare the same spell (and only that spell) in that slot again without requiring rest. This is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. This action requires concentration like casting a spell. If you are interrupted, the imprint remains, so you may try again. The imprint, (and thus a spell prepared again using it) retains any metamagic feats it was originally prepared with.(Normally, this includes the Specific Recharge Spell metamagic feat itself, so the cycle can be repeated.) The imprint cannot be used to prepare that spell with different metamagic feats than before.\n If you use a specific recharge spell as a counterspell, or to dispell another spell, the cooldown period is reduced to 1 minute. If your specific recharge spell is successfully countered, make a spellcraft check DC 15 +1 per level of your spell. If you fail, the imprint remains, but the slot is still locked for twice the normal cooldown period (max 24 hrs.). If you fail by 5 or more, the imprint is lost instead. If you succeed, the imprint remains, but the normal cooldown still applies. If you succeed by 5 or more, the imprint remains and the cooldown time is reduced to 1 minute. If a specific recharge spell casting fails for some other reason (loss of concentration, a mage in armor, etc.) no check is required; the imprint remains, but the slot still becomes locked for its normal cooldown period.\n You can expend a specific recharge spell, or spell imprint (even while the slot is locked) to pay for abilities that consume prepared spells (like a good cleric spontaneously casting a cure spell), but the imprint is lost, so you must rest as normal before preparing a spell in that slot again. An emptied slot is no longer locked, even if the cooldown period wasn't over. (You can always empty a locked slot to make room to prepare another spell normally.)\n\nA specific recharge spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell’s actual level. You may cut the cooldown time by using up a slot higher than this. The time is halved for each additional spell level (minimum 5 minutes).","Normal":"Preparing spells again normally requires 8 hours of rest.","Special":"See the recharge magic variant in Unearthed Arcana for cooldown times, which spells have specific cooldown times, and which spells are forbidden in that variant.

The character can avoid manifesting each uncontrolled power by making a Concentration check with a DC of 15. One check is needed per rest period for each uncontrolled power. The consequences of failure are described below:\nSpecial: This Feat must be selected during initial character creation, as those not born with the Gift can never gain it later. Furthermore, those who select it must deduct 2 points of Constitution.

A randomly-selected unused spell will be discharged, affecting a suitable target within spell range. This can be avoided by deliberately discharging all spells before sleeping (equivalent to deliberately failing a Concentration check when casting), but this will obviously leave the psychic with no spells left to cope with nocturnal emergencies.\n\nUncontrolled Telepathy (Cha 13)\nAnother randomly-selected person sleeping within 60 feet of the psychic will have nightmares, negating all benefits of the rest period (no hit points regained, unable to regain spells).

Items made with this feat are not capable of inflicting damage and cannot grant bonuses of any type. No magical backlash occurs if one of these items are broken. On high-magic worlds these minor items might be ubiquitous, being used as toys or useful household articles. Items created by this feat are scarcer on low-magic worlds. The market price of a minor wondrous item is left to the DMs discretion, but will typically be between 10 and 100 gp, or ten times the cost of the base item.","Normal":"","Special":"Wizards may select this feat instead of Scribe Scroll at 1st level.","Link":"https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Toymaker_(3.5e_Feat)"},{"Name":"Trail of Blood [Epic]","Description":"","Prerequisite":"Dex 21, any evil alignment,Mobility, Power Attack, Great Cleave, base attack bonus +21","Benefit":"If you deal a creature enough damage to make it drop (typically by dropping it to below 0 hit points or killing it), you can immediately move up to your movement speed and make an extra melee attack as a free action.

The bonus increases to +5 at 3rd level, and thereafter increases by +1 for each 3 character levels. This bonus does not apply to touch attacks and does not hinder incorporeal touch attacks. Brilliant Energy weapons, and similar effects, however, do not ignore this bonus. This does not stack with an armor bonus.\nBonus Equilibrium Feats: At 1st level, an Unburdened Walker gets a bonus equilibrium feat, fighter bonus feat, or metamagic feat, and another bonus feat at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter. Unlike other benefits of being an Unburdened Walker, a character does not gain these bonus feats retroactively when they take the Unburdened Walker feat; they gain only those bonus feats that apply for the levels they gain after becoming Unburdened.\nEndure Elements (Ex): A 3rd-level Unburdened Walker is immune to the effects of being in a hot or cold environment. They can exist comfortably in conditions between -50 and 140 degrees fahrenheit without having to make Fortitude saves (as described in the Dungeon Master's Guide).\nEquilibrium Strike (Su): At 4th level, an Unburdened Walker gains a +1 enhancement bonus on all their attack and damage rolls. In effect, any weapon the character wields becomes a +1 magic weapon, and overcome the damage reduction of a creature as though it were a magic weapon. This enhancement bonus rises to +2 at 10th level, to +3 at 14th level, to +4 at 17th level, and to +5 at 20th level. At 10th level, the character chooses the force they will devote themselves to balancing. It may be Good, Evil, Law, or Chaos. From that point on, the weapon damage the character deals is also considered to be of the opposing alignment, so that it can bypass the damage reduction of some of those creatures whom they oppose.\nSustenance (Ex): A 5th-level Unburdened Walker doesn't need to eat or drink.\nDeflection (Su): A 6th-level Unburdened Walker receives a +1 deflection bonus to their Armor Class. This bonus increases to +2 at 12th level, and to +3 at 18th\nResistance (Ex): At 7th level, an Unburdened Walker gains a +1 resistance bonus on all saving throws. This bonus increases to +2 at 13th level and to +3 at 17th level.\nAbility Score Enhancement (Ex): At 7th level, an Unburdened Walker gains a +2 enhancement bonus to one ability score. At 11th level, they gain an extra +2 bonus to that score, and a +2 bonus to another ability score. At 15th level, they gain an extra +2 bonus to those two scores, and a +2 bonus to a third ability score. At 19th level, they gain an extra +2 bonus to those three scores, and a +2 bonus to a fourth ability score.\nNatural Armor (Ex): At 8th level, an Unburdened Walker gains a +1 natural armor bonus, or their existing natural armor bonus increases by +1. It increases an extra +1 at 16th level.\nMind Shielding (Ex): Also at 8th level, an Unburdened Walker character becomes immune to detect thoughts, discern lies, and any attempt to discern their alignment.\nDamage Reduction (Su): An Unburdened Walker gains damage reduction 5/magic at 10th level. At 15th level, this improves to a damage resistance 10 that is only surpassed by damage that bears the damage type the Unburdened Walker chose to oppose at 10th level for their Equilibrium Strike. For instance, if the Unburdened Walker has chosen to balance against the force of Good, their Equilibrium Strike would grant their attacks Evil typed damage and their Damage Reduction would be vulnerable to Good aligned damage.\nGreater Sustenance (Ex): Once they attain 12th level, an Unburdened Walker character doesn't need to breathe.\nEnergy Resistance (Ex): At 13th level, an Unburdened Walker gains resistance 5 to acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic energy. At 20th level, this increases to resistance 15.\nFreedom of Movement (Ex): At 14th level, an Unburdened Walker can act as if continually under the effect of a freedom of movement spell.\nRegeneration (Ex): At 17th level, an Unburdened Walker heals 1 point of damage per level every hour rather than every day. (This ability cannot be aided by the Heal skill.) Nonlethal damage heals at a rate of 1 point of damage per level every 5 minutes.\n\nTrue Seeing (Su): At 18th level, an ascetic gains a continuous true seeing ability, as the spell.","Normal":"","Special":"If the character ever defies this lifestyle, they lose this feat and it's benefits until they receive atonement.

You can use each selected one 1/day as a full round action (you pay 500 XP each time you use it to change it to a immediate action). You can also use it additional times per day if you pay 500 XP each time you want to use it additionally if you have run out of slots. These spell-like abilities have no verbal or somatic components, and normally no XP component either. You are allowed to select the same ability more than once. These can be used as you choose even if you are under control by someone/something else, and nobody can force you to use these, either.\nAbility Subtraction: Caster takes up to 5 points (you may specify the exact amount 0-5) of ability damage to a ability score of your choice. This ability damage heals at a rate of 1 point per round (this does not heal any other ability damage).\nArcane Rock: Creates a small rock which radiates magic but has no other magical effects.\nBlack Deck:* Select any card from the Deck of Many Things, which must be of the spades or clubs suit (hearts, diamonds, and jokers, may not be selected). This effect happens to you immediately.\nColored Air: Colors all air within a 50 ft radius of the caster, for 1 minute. This partially blinds everyone in the area (including the caster). You can specify the color upon casting.\nDancing Lights: All light sources within 35 ft animate and dance to the tune of music. This does not obscure any vision and has no combat effect. It lasts for 5 minutes.\nDeath to the Caster: Instantly kills the caster (no save). You may specify what kind of appearance it is to anyone to attempts to figure out how you got killed.\nDetect Prime:* Select any target you can see within 30 ft. For each of these attributes of the target, it tells you whether or not the current value is prime (1 and less are not prime): Current HP, Armor Class, Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, Psionic Power Points, Level.\nFake Gold Piece: Creates a permanent fake gold piece. It looks like real money, however, if it is spent they can make Bluff check DC 17, or recognize as fake. Once per day, at the same time of day this ability was cast (including at the exact time it was cast), it emit a shower of sparks, dealing 3d4 damage to the holder and all adjacent characters.\nFeign Invisibility: Makes other creatures believe the caster is invisible (but does not actually make the caster invisible), but other creatures believe that somehow they are now able to see the caster even while they are invisible (no save, unless the creatures really can't see the caster (because of blindness or something), in which case it is Will DC 15). Lasts for 3 rounds.\nFind Terrain:* If there is a ground for the caster to fall forward onto and the caster is upright, the caster does immediately fall down onto that ground and causes the caster to take 1d4 points of damage from the fall (can be more or less depending on circumstances). This also allows the caster to know what the ground is made of. It can be used even if the caster is currently incapable of movement, however, this does not cause the caster to become capable of movement. Also, if the caster is tied to something and is too far away from the ground for the rope (or other item) to reach, this effect does nothing.\nHallucination: Causes the caster to hallucinate for 1 minute (not dismissible).\nMessy Floor:* Makes the floor in the immediate area to be messy and dirty. It is not become dangerous by being in this state.\nMother: Causes a touched target to believe they are your mother, regardless of gender or if they are a different kind of creature, or anything else. Lasts for 6 rounds.\nMouthful of Crabs: Creates crabs in the caster's mouth (if you have no mouth, this has no effect). They remain there until removed, which takes a full round action. The caster takes 2d4 damage instantly, and another 2d4 every minute the crabs remain in the mouth.\nNarwhal Figure: Creates a permanent tiny plastic figurine of a confused whale with a horn.\nNegate Useless Magic:* Negates any effect caused by this feat (except the ones with asterisks). If an item was created, that item is now destroyed. You must be within 30 ft of the effect, however it is not necessary to see it.\nNightmare: Caster falls asleep and has a nightmare. (This does not count as the rest for the day, unless you have been awake and completely unrested for 100 hours consecutively)\nObscure Object: Creates an object with no discernable purpose.\nRandom Magic: Roll on Table 7-20 and either Table 7-23 or Table 7-24 to select a random 0-level spell. The spell is cast with no components, with the target being the caster. The caster level is 1.\nRemove Hand:* Spellcaster's hand falls off. You may select which one. Cannot be fixed by Negate Useless Magic, but Limited Wish, Wish, Miracle, can instantly fix it, also anything that would normally allow your hand to be reattached will also fix it.\nRimshot: Make a rimshot noise in the background. It doesn't do any damage, and there isn't a physical object to make the noise.\nSelf Inflicting: Does 1 point of damage to the caster (no save). Anyone else who tries to figure out, it seems as a strong effect of healing, even though it isn't.\nSkill Subtraction: Caster loses 2 ranks in a specified skill for 1 minute. You can even specify literacy as the skill (even if you are not a barbarian), and if Speak Language is selected, you can even lose languages that you have not learned by the use of this skill.\nStatic Charge: Fills the caster's body with energizing, harmless static electricity. With a touch attack, this charge may be released directly into another person or object. If a person, the charge has no effect except minor annoyance. If a metal object, such as a weapon, it retains the charge until a person touches it, at which point it releases the shock into the person. The spell is good for one shock.\nSummon Grue: Can be used only when pitch dark in the area, with no light sources nearby. Summons a grue, which has infinite hit-points, and which does 5d20 damage to each creature within a 30 ft radius of the caster (including the caster) as long as nothing blocking movement is in the way. The caster cannot prevent this damage to themself. After damage is dealt, or if anyone becomes capable of seeing the grue, it vanishes immediately.\nSummon Housefly: Summons a housefly to annoy the caster for 5 minutes.\nTinfoil Hat: Creates a tinfoil hat which lasts for 2 minutes. Protects the user from mind-reading effects. Also -5 penalty to Charisma.\nVulnerability: Causes caster's armor class to be reduced to negative infinity for five minutes. The caster can dismiss this effect at any time.\nWater Squirting Flower: Creates a permanent flower which squirts a harmless stream of annoying yet drinkable water on command. The command can be any verbal or mental command that the caster specifies upon casting. Usable only once per minute. It is not required to be holding this item to activate it, but whoever is activating it must be near it.\nWish:* Make any wish. The DM twists and changes it to make it very worse than anything. If this is not possible, or if you are being too specific, this fails. Costs 5000 XP just like a normal wish does (even if it fails).\n","Normal":"","Special":"Multiple times","Link":"https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Useless_Magecraft_(3.5e_Feat)"},{"Name":"Usurp Spell [Special]","Description":"You can attempt to steal control of any spell that you successfully counterspell.","Prerequisite":"Knowledge (arcana) 5 ranks, Spellcraft 5 ranks","Benefit":"After a successful counterspell using a prepared spell rather than a dispel check, you can attempt to steal control of the spell being cast.

First you must designate which weapon the Feat applies toward, as normal, and second you may select any one of your Abilities (Str, Dex, Con, Int, Wis, Cha) and apply an appropriate bonus when using that weapon;\nStrength: When you select Strength, you now gain a +4 bonus when using this weapon for Disarm or Sunder. You may also make a single devastating strike against your opponent's shield at your highest BAB as a Full-Round Action. Treat this as a Sunder Attempt, and if you are successful your opponent is considered Staggered until the end of your next Round. This applies to Ranged Weapons as well; Consider that you threw or fired your projectile at their weapon or shield.\nDexterity: When you select Dexterity, your weapon is now capable of being used to make Trip Attempts, even if the weapon naturally can not do so. Additionally you gain a +4 bonus when using this weapon for a Trip Attempt. If you use this Ability for Ranged Weapons, the distance you can fire a projectile increases by +20 feet, while the distance you can throw a projectile increases by +10 feet.\nConstitution: When you select Constitution, you are now so skilled in the weapon's use that you cause 1d4 Bleeding Damage that begins at the beginning of your next Round. This damage does not stack upon itself, however it will work in conjunction with other effects that cause Bleeding Damage. To stop this, the typical Heal DC 15 is in place, or until someone uses magical healing that stops Bleeding Damage. This only applies to Piercing or Slashing Weapons. When using a Bludgeoning Weapon the bleeding is internal. For the purposes of balance, this type is considered Non-Lethal. However, because surgery would effectively be required to cut open the body, find the wound, create an applicable suture, and mend the body shut the Heal DC is increased to 25 and effectively takes 6d4 minutes to preform. However any magical healing will cure the bleeding normally. Additionally when the victim falls unconscious from blood loss due to Non-Lethal Damage it changes to Lethal Damage. A weapon which has either Bludgeoning and Slashing or Bludgeoning and Piercing can be used for either Lethal or Non-Lethal Damage; The player must choose one or the other. This damage in general does not multiply upon a successful Critical Hit.\nIntelligence: When you select Intelligence, you are now more knowledgeable as toward your opponent and your weapon. You gain a +4 to your Attack Rolls and a +4 to your rolls to confirm a Critical. This bonus stacks with similar effects, such as the Feat Power Critical.\nWisdom: When you select Wisdom, you are now more keenly aware of your situation and how to react properly. When wielding the weapon you gain a +2 Deflection AC Bonus, as if you have Parry (Which stacks with this bonus). When an opponent is wielding the same or similar weapon, you gain an additional +2 Dodge AC Bonus. This is because you understand what movements they must make in order to use the weapon properly, and thus can anticipate their strikes and react accordingly. Your Critical Threat Range also increases by +1, and when your opponent uses the same or similar weapon against you their Critical Threat Range decreases by -1 to a minimum of 20. The Dodge AC Bonus will stack with similar effects that grant you Dodge AC. The +1 to the Critical Threat Range is an external modifier, so when using Feats which multiply your Critical Threat Range, such as Improved Critical or the Weapon Enchantment Keen, add the +1 CTR Bonus after you have increased your base CTR, not before.\nCharisma: When you select Charisma, you are now able to catch your opponents off guard much more easily. You gain a +2 deflection bonus for your AC which stacks with similar Feats, such as Parry. You also are able to make one additional Feint Attempt per Round as a Move Action or Standard Action, even if you have previously failed a prior Feint Attempt. However, when making a second Feint, you take a -5 Penalty. Any Feats which may govern changes to the use of Feint may apply. (It is recognized by the author that Feint naturally is a Standard Action and therefore this would imply that the player could waste an entire Round merely standing in one place taunting and mocking their opponent. It should be understood that a wide verity of Feats change how Feint is used; Improved Feint causes it to become a Move Action instead of a Standard Action; Master Feint causes an additional 1d6 damage upon your successful strike immediately following a successful Feint, Quick Swap allows you to make a Feint as a Free Action, Superior Feint allows you to make a Feint as a Swift Action, Unbalancing Feint causes your opponent to become Flat-Footed, and Vexing Feint causes your opponent to lose their Dexterity Modifier. When using VGWS:Cha as itself it cause is unjust, mundane, and overall pointless. Be sure you check around before wasting a Feat on something that may initially cause more harm than good.)","Normal":"Greater Weapon Specialization only gives you an additional +2 bonus to Damage Rolls (In conjunction with Weapon Specialization for a total of +4).","Special":"A revamped version of Greater Weapon Specialization","Link":"https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Variant_Greater_Weapon_Specialization_(3.5e_Feat)"},{"Name":"Variant Weapon Focus [General, Fighter]","Description":"A variant of the general Weapon Focus feat that scales with levels.","Prerequisite":"Proficiency with selected weapon, Base Attack Bonus +1.","Benefit":"Choose one type of weapon.

However, It can only be gained at 1st level.\nAncient Backgrounds\nApostle of the Forgotten: The temples are ruined, the idols long since gone to dust. Where once a thousand voices cried out, now only one pushes back the tide of darkness; a once mighty deity now resides only within a single soul, one priest or simple believer to hold aside the tide of oblivion. The last servant of a forgotten deity, you possess a profound sense of loss, and a thin sliver of deific power remains, however small, for you to draw upon.\nSpecial Ability: You gain a +1 insight bonus to your initiative checks. Once per day, you can use an effect that duplicates the spell augury, but it can only see one minute into the future.\n\nElder of Legend: You possess the reputation of a historical figure; you could be a legend among your people, power and influence that has waxed and waned over the years. Even if all power has slipped through your fingers like dust, at least a shard of this respect remains. People who know of you teat you with more respect and at least lend their ears; after all, you have made or buried fortunes and civilizations.\nSpecial Ability: Whenever you make a Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate check against someone who knows your name and nature, you gain a +3 bonus.\nGolden Ager: Born in an age of glory and wonder, the Golden Ager remembers the mythical past, the power of a civilization resplendent in the awe of magic. Perhaps floating islands dotted the heavens or glittering spires reached toward the stars. Somehow, though, disaster struck, and the wonders crashed back to the soil, but you survived, melting into the background of history. You still possess a startling grasp of magical theory despite this.\nSpecial Ability: You always treat Use Magic Device as a class skill, and can use it untrained. You only suffer a mishap if you fail a check by 15 or more.\n\nHand of Prophecy:\nBlessed and cursed by the arbiters of fate, by strange spirit the forces of time itself, or some other esoteric means, you are guided through the ages by a hand that pushes you ever forward. Whether reborn over and over again, memories returned at a special age or simply not allowed to age or die by the cruel whims of life, the Hand of Prophecy drifts through the ages until at last, destiny has been fulfilled.\nSpecial Ability: You are guided by the hand of fate, but you have some small insight to the machinations of your destiny. Once per day, you may designate a creature you oppose in combat as your nemesis, your rival or opposite as a free action. You gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls and skill checks when dealing with that creature.\n\nSurvivor:\nToo weak, too slow, too unfit. You have plowed through the decades or even centuries with an uncanny fortitude that astounded your contemporaries and continues to do so even now. Your outlook is tempered by this survival, beating back time and age through sheer force of will, running on nothing more than mental might alone. You possess a desire to exist that would frighten many.\nSpecial Ability: Whenever you must make a Fortitude or Reflex save, you may make a Will save instead. Each time you use this ability after the first, you suffer a cumulative -1 penalty to all Will saves for the rest of the day.\n\nThrowback:\nYou are the final holdover from the last stage of your race's evolution. You might even be the first of your race, still wandering the world, gaining and losing power as you do. You have lived since time had even yet to make mortality, and so wander from age to age, reinventing yourself as you choose.\nSpecial Ability: You possess strange quirks of mentality and physiology that affect both mundane and magical attempts to disrupt your body. Attacks and effects normally geared toward your creature type have no effect; this includes a Ranger's favored enemy bonus, bane weapons, and spell effects geared to creature types (such as charm person). On the other hand, you are also immune to beneficial effects that affect such types as well, should you run into any.\n\nWanderer\nPlace to place, horizon to the sea, you've been everywhere and seen it all; you may have even forgotten how you got to live so long. It could have been that night with the goddess of spring, or the mermaid's flesh you ate, the strange spring in the mountains, the unearthly energies from the yawning vortex, or even the crucible of wailing souls you encountered. You are witness to wonders and horrors both, and yet even still perhaps seek the city in you dreams.\n\nSpecial Ability: You may use any untrained skill, even if you have no ranks in it, but you have a -2 penalty on the check if the skill is one you could not normally use untrained.
